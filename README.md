# grade-debugger

C programming assignment for my Systems Fundamentals II course (CSE 320)

By completing this homework I became more familiar with C and developed an understanding of:

-How to use tools such as gdb and valgrind for debugging C code.

-Modifying existing C code.

-C memory management and pointers.

-Working with files and the C standard I/O library.
